Attempt 1 fails because decoding the maps results in terrible performance (enormous dictionaries). THINKING TOO LITERALLY. Instead, don't decode them and apply the code instead of looking for the decoded values

Part 2 requires a similar logic jump, using the seed ranges rather than a map over the seeds. I still need to figure out how to do this and then how to implement this.

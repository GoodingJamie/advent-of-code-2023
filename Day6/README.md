The speed of a boat can be written as
$$ v = at$$
where $a$ is the acceleration (speed gained from time held down, $t$). The distance can therefore be written as
$$ d = v(T-t) = at(T-t) $$
where $T$ is the total time elapsed, such that $T-t$ gives the time elapsed without the button held down. Nice!
